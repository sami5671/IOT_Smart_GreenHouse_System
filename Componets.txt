Feature 1: Soil & Pump
Read soilPercent; if <40%, Relay 1 ON powers pump. If the soilpercent if 80% power off the pump

Feature 2: Temp & Humidity
DHT22 for temp and humidity. If temperature is high like 50 degree celcies cross a threshold then turn on mist. When temperature is below 28 degree turn off mist

Feature 3: Light & Grow Lamp
BH1750 for getting low light. If it get low light turn on some LED blubs

Feature 4: Air Quality
MQ‑135 for getting gas sensing. If it detects the gas or poor air it will turn on the adjust fan.
Feature 5: Water Level
Water Level Sensor Depth of Detection from sensor to water. If distance > threshold (e.g., <10 cm), turn on the reservoir pump and if the tank full then turn of the pump.
